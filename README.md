# OC_SORT-From-MATLAB
This was tested with Python 3.8 and MATLAB 2021a. Make sure you have python setup with MATLAB. This is quick example showing how to pass a MOT-Challenge detection file to OCSORT from MATLAB and get the tracking results in return. A description of the methodology of OCSORT can be found https://github.com/noahcao/OC_SORT and https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14360.

The python script run_ocsort_once.py was adapted from the original author's work which can be found here: https://github.com/noahcao/OC_SORT/blob/master/tools/run_ocsort_public.py

Only a minor change was made to the OCSORT class init function. To ensure you are using an up-to-date version of OCSORT, you can copy over the files from here: https://github.com/noahcao/OC_SORT/tree/master/trackers/ocsort_tracker and place them in the equivalent folder of this project.  Then compare my class definition / init function of OCSORT to the official copy and make sure they are the same.  The change I made was just to try to ensure that variables are passed in and not overwritten.  I am not maintaining this repo, it is only there for the benefit of the OC_SORT community - hopefully it is useful and saves you a couple hours.
